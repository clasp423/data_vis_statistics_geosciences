# Data Visualization & Statistics in the Geosciences 2020

This repository contains the laboratory portion of a split upper level
undergraduate / graduate class in Python on data visualization and statistics
for geo &amp; space scientists.
Labs were updated in April at the conclusion of the Winter 2020 term.
The previous versions may be found in the other branches as well as on as
well as on github.com/abbyazari. 

The labs uploaded are in Jupyter primarily and coded in Python 3.5+.
However, most of the functions and methods should work in Python 2.7.
If you do not have/know what Jupyter is - you can download Python/Jupyter
from Anaconda or Canopy as a fully installed and interactive environment.
This will support most if not all of the packages used in the labs and then
you can navigate to Jupyter through Anaconda/Canopy. Also see
[the Jupyter website](https://www.jupyter.org) for additional help with Jupyter.

Make sure you check out the
[Frequently Asked Questions](https://github.com/clasp423/data_vis_statistics_geosciences/blob/master/FAQ/FAQ.md)
section as you go through the labs. 

Please see our liscense at the end of this readme.
This class has been developed in collaboration between
[Dr. Michael Liemohn](http://clasp.engin.umich.edu/people/liemohn)
of the Climate & Space Sciences & Engineering department and 
[Abby Azari](https://abbyazari.github.io/). The 2019 and 2020 versions were
updated with the assistance of [Brian Swiger](https://github.com/briswi).
