# Data Visualization & Statistics in the Geosciences 2020

This repository contains the laboratory portion of a split upper level undergraduate / graduate class in Python on data visualization and statistics for geo &amp; space scientists. Labs will be updated from January - May at the same cadence as the course (2020). The previous versions may be found in the other branches as well as on as well as on github.com/astro-abby. 

The labs uploaded will be in Jupyter primarily and coded in Python 3.5+. However, most of the functions and methods should work in Python 2.7. If you do not have/know what Jupyter is - you can download Python/Jupyter from Anaconda or Canopy as a fully installed and interactive environment. This will support most if not all of the packages used in the labs and then you can navigate to Jupyter through Anaconda/Canopy.

Make sure you check out the [Frequently Asked Questions](https://github.com/astro-abby/data_vis_statistics_geosciences/blob/master/FAQ/FAQ.md) section as you go through the labs. 

Please see our liscense at the end of this readme. This class has been developed in collaboration between [Dr. Michael Liemohn](http://clasp.engin.umich.edu/people/liemohn) of the Climate & Space Sciences & Engineering department and [Abby Azari](https://astro-abby.github.io/). The 2019 version updated with the assistance of [Brian Swiger](https://github.com/briswi).
